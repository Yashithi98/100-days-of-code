# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I decided to brush up my coding skills from the very beginning. Usually I'm comfortable with coding languages like C and C++, thereby for the first few weeks of this challenge I will be learning and doing these coding challenges in JAVA. In addition, I worked on my group project called 'MediHub'.

**Thoughts:** I found these questions really easy in my head as I have done programming before, however, since I haven't coded in a long time it was still equally challenging to get back on my feet. With continuous practice I think I will get better at coding in general.
